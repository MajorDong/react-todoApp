This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

1. img标签图片问题
2. Appbar 的左icon在首页点击问题，加入一个selected判断解决
3. 一个bug解决了一上午，发现是todolidst组件和tododetail组件渲染不一致导致，在进行页面增加删除操作的时候，页面不会根据Newprops更新组件，重写了todolist的选择逻辑和tododetail的数据来源解决。
4. 一个bug通过currentIndex选择todo的的逻辑有问题，导致在左右两端无法选择到todo，
重写reducer的PREV_TODO和NEXT_TODO，改用余数。
5. 一个bug，在使用的时候发现，如果所有认为都完成并删除，Todo组件的进度条num会出现0/0 返回NaN的情况，让progress函数不返回字符串返回数字，渲染时进行falsy值判断解决。
